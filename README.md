This is task 2 of the Rubyist test.

We have to write a class takeaway.
The following functionalities have to be implemented:
	
1.	List of dishes.
2.	Placing order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and the total. 
3.	If the sum is not correct, it should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying the order was placed 		 and will be delivered 1 hour from now.
4.	Twilio API should be used to implement text sending functionality.
